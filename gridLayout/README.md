The selected CSS code defines a responsive layout for a container and its child boxes. Here's a detailed explanation of the code:

1. The `.container` class is defined with a width of 100% of the viewport (`100vw`). It uses the `display:grid` property to create a grid layout with three columns (`grid-template-columns: auto auto auto`). The background color of the container is set to blue (`background:blue;`).

2. The `.box` class is defined with a height of 360px, padding of 32px, a red background color (`background:red;`), and a 2px solid black border (`border:2px solid black;`).

3. A media query is used to define a different layout for screens with a maximum width of 480px. In this case, the grid layout is changed to have only two columns (`grid-template-columns: auto auto;`). The height and padding of the boxes are also adjusted for smaller screens (`height:240px;` and `padding: 12px;`).

In summary, this CSS code defines a responsive layout for a container and its child boxes, with different styles applied based on the screen size.
