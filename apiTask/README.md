The provided JavaScript file is a script that sends multiple POST requests to a specified endpoint using the fetch API. The requests are sent asynchronously, and the results are collected and processed using Promise.allSettled. Here's a detailed explanation of the code:

1.
The sendRequest function is defined as an asynchronous function. It takes two parameters: payloads (an array of payloads to be sent in the requests) and endpoint (the URL of the API endpoint to which the requests will be sent).
2.
Inside the function, a map function is used to create an array of fetch requests for each payload in the payloads array. Each request is sent as a POST request with the payload as the request body.
3.
The then function is used to process the responses from the requests. It converts the responses to JSON format and returns an array of promises.
4.
The catch function is used to handle any errors that may occur during the requests. It returns an object with an error property containing the error message.
5.
The await keyword is used to wait for the promises returned by Promise.allSettled to be resolved. This allows the results of the requests to be processed and returned by the function.
6.
The endPoint variable is assigned the URL of the API endpoint to which the requests will be sent.
7.
The payloads variable is assigned an array of payloads to be sent in the requests.
8.
The sendRequest function is called with the payloads and endPoint variables as arguments. The results of the requests are then logged to the console using console.log.


In summary, this JavaScript file sends multiple asynchronous POST requests to an API endpoint and processes the results using Promise.allSettled. The results are then logged to the console.
