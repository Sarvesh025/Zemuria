The selected JavaScript code demonstrates the concept of memoization, which is a technique used to optimize the performance of functions by storing their results so that they can be quickly retrieved when needed. Here's a detailed explanation of the code:

1. The `add` function is defined as a simple function that adds 10 to its argument.
2. The `add(9)` statement calls the `add` function with the argument 9 and logs the result to the console.
3. The `memo` function is defined as a higher-order function that returns a new function. This new function uses an object `cache` to store the results of its calculations.
4. The `newAdd` variable is assigned the result of calling the `memo` function with no arguments. This assigns the new function returned by `memo` to `newAdd`.
5. The `console.log(newAdd(6))` statement calls the `newAdd` function with the argument 6 and logs the result to the console. Since this is the first time `newAdd(6)` is called, the result is calculated and stored in the `cache` object.
6. The `console.log(newAdd(6))` statement is called again with the same argument 6. This time, since the result is already stored in the `cache` object, the function retrieves the cached result and logs it to the console.

In summary, this JavaScript code demonstrates the concept of memoization by creating a new function `newAdd` that uses memoization to optimize its performance.
